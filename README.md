### The rule of 72

> In order to find out the number of cycles (usually years) in which an investment doubles in size, then you need to follow the equation: `72 / interest = no_of_cycles`. If the rate of return on your investment is 10%/year then your investment will double in size in 72 / 10 = 7.2 years! 

> The "Rule of 72" is a shortcut for a more math worthy formula which yields the same result: `ln(2) / ln(1 + interest_percent) = no_cycles`, where `ln` is the natural logarithm or `logE` logarithm in base `e` (Euler's number, 2.71828). No need to learn it, but it is a fun economics math formula. Example, for 10%/year interest the formula will be `ln(2) / ln(1 + 0.10) = 7.2' same number as before.

## Books 📚

### The Psychology of Money

> Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money investing, personal finance, and business decisions is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.
