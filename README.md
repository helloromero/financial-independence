## Books 📚

### The Psychology of Money

> Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money investing, personal finance, and business decisions is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.
